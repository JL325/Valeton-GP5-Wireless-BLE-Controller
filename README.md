# Valeton-GP5-Wireless-BLE-Controller

**Fully wireless control for your Valeton GP-5!**  
This BLE Bridge allows you to sync presets, switch effects, adjust delay and tempo, and connect multiple devices—all without USB restrictions.

Currently, the device still requires an external power source, but a battery module will be added soon for true wireless operation.

> GP-5 cannot connect to other devices while linked to the mobile app, unless using a USB cable to the pedal.  
> This project was developed to provide more freedom and expandability.
